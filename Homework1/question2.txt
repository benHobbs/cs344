Revision Control Systems:
    A revision control system, is a program that allows a user or team of
users to control the revisions on their projects/files. In short, it allows
for storage, retrieval and logging of revised files in a manner that
facilitates ease of access and eliminates accidental overwriting.

   They are useful because they allow a user to modify code without impacting
the original files, and also because the allow for collaboration of multiple
users on the same project without fear of accidental deletions or overwrites.

Examples(4 with 3 commands each):
    git
    -git init							(create a new local repository)
    -git add <filename>    	(add file to staging, before commit)
    -git commit -a          		(commit the files you added with add)
    cvs
    -cvs checkout <dir>     (reserve files you want to edit)
    -cvs add <filename>  	(add file to working directory)
    -update                 		(brings a checked out directory up to date)
    Mercurial
    -hg clone               		(creates a copy of a directory to work on)
    -hg sum                 		(summerize the state of the working directory)
    -hg init                			(create a new local repository)
    svn
    -svn co                 		(reserve files you want to edit)
    -svn propset            		(sets properties of working directory)
    -svn delete             		(deletes after commit)
