Partition Discussion

To be completely honest, I though up two different ways to attack this problem:

The first involved giving the earlier process exponentially more numbers, and the second
involved a multiplicative approach.  However, for my first implementation I simply divided
the search ranges equally between each thread/process.  With 500 threads/processes,
the programs that I wrote were able to beat the goal of 43 seconds, and I decided that it
was a classic case of diminishing returns.  Ideally, it would make sense to do some testing
with single processes to see how much time certain ranges of numbers take to prime (it's
a verb now), however, as I am in the process of moving all of my worldly possessions across
the country (and beyond), I am pretty happy that it all runs.  Hopefully you are as well.
